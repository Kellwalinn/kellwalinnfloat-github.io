  <h4>
  Care, Diets, and Exercise.
  </h4>
  <p>Supervise your pet as you would a toddler. Keep doors closed, pick up after yourself, and block off rooms as necessary. This will keep her out of trouble and away from objects she shouldn’t put in her mouth.</p>
  <p>Give a thorough brushing at least weekly most of the year. Twice a year she blows her coat and loses crazy amounts of hair; daily brushing is recommended during this time.</p>
  <p>Keep your dog’s diet consistent and don’t give her people food. Feed a high-quality diet appropriate for its age.</p>
  <p>Exercise your dog regularly, but don’t overdo it at first.</p>
